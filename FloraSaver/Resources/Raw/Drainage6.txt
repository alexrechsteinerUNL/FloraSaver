So plants gotta drain. #$ Those roots need oxygen and they will not get it if they're constantly water logged. #$ BUT GUESS WHAT! #$ EVERY TIME I GO TO BUY A PLANT BASE #$ THEY EITHER DON'T HAVE A HOLE #$ OR DON'T COME WITH THE BASE PART #$ SO I ASK THE PLANT GUY AT THE PLANT STORE #$ AND THEY'RE JUST LIKE #$ "oh yeah we'll drill one for 10 bucks" #$ WHAT! #$ AN ABSOLUTE RACKET I TELL YA! #$ Then I still gotta buy a base. #$ Because otherwise the water is just gonna trickle out onto my counter #$ I've refused on principal. #$ I've been using yogurt cups as bases. #$ This is what society has done to me! #$
