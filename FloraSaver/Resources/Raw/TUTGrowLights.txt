Lets talk grow lights.#$You can go out#$and buy yourself top of the line, industrial grade, aftermarket headlights lookin' grow lights.#$They'll work fine.#$HOWEVER#$What if you don't have money?#$Well, there are plenty of LED lights that can do a great job!#$When buying them you're gonna want to look for 'full spectrum lights'.#$To you, it's just going to look like a white bulb, but those plants will be eatin' good. #$
