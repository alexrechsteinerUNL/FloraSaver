So, as you might have noticed there's a third option after watering and misting. #$ BUT! None of the autofills enable this option by default #$ This is for moving plants for sunlight, but a lot of plants don't really need this option #$ and, for some of them like plants in a garden, it's kinda unlikely you'll be doing that. #$But here's an idea #$ Use that third option for anything else you do with your plants #$ Pulling up weeds, light therapy, whatever you want. It don't matter! #$ These are your plants, why should I control them? #$
