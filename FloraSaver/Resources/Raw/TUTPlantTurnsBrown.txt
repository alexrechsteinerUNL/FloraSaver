Uh oh! #$ A plant you have is going from green to brown! #$ Unfortunately it's TERMINAL. #$ Not really, but once they get brown they can't really get un-brown #$ There are a lot of reasons this could happen #$ It could be overwatering or bad bug infestations #$ But it's probably because your plant is under-watered for the environment it's in, #$ and your room is really dry too #$ It's especially important to mist plants that need high humidity #$ Anyway, if you can you should probably cut those brown parts off, and if the leaf is super brown you should just cut that leaf off #$ Unlike you and me, plants can regenerate #$
