Ah those treats were so good! Oh thank you so much! Bless You! #$ So the name Clipet it's actually my last name. #$ My full name is 'Valentin Clipet'. #$ So, that 't' at the end is pronounced like 'Buffet' or 'Ballet'. #$ Clipieh, Clipea, Clipeey! #$ See when my great great grandfather came off the boat at Ellis island, #$ He wanted to making that T sound not-silent #$ But my great great grandma #$ was having none of that. #$ So it's been engrained in me that I gotta correct anyone #$ that pronounces it wrong. #$ When I was a fawn I hated it so much. #$ I'd have to be like, "Well actually the T is silent" #$ and everyone hated it #$
