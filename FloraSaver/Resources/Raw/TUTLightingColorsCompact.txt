Here's the details#$Most important is Visible Light (400-750nm)#$ great for plant growth and photosynthesis your bulb should have the most of this.#$Next is Red Light (600-750nm):#$ It's great for photosynthesis and it helps plants grow outward and big!#$Then we have UV light (10-399nm)#$ This is all about flowers, color, and smell (it will not help photosynthesis)#$Last we got Blue Light (400-500nm)#$ This does help for photosynthesis but will make your plants grow denser and more compact.
