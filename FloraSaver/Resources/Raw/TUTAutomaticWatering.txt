OH did you know about these little cones you can buy that automatically water plants? #$
They're called 'Plant Watering Stakes' #$
To use them you need to have a water source nearby like a gallon jug of water #$
Then you put one end in the water source and the spiky end in the plant #$
And the plant will drink the water it needs from that! #$
Now, if you're asking why this app exists if these could just do all the work for me? #$
Think about this. #$
How else to talk with me...? #$
Not really selling you, am I... OOPS. #$
