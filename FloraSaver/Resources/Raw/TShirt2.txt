Thanks for those treats! They were magnifique! #$ So, let's go through the details that you have been dying to ask me. #$ First, probably... #$ Why am I wearing this white T-Shirt? #$ Well I gotta comply with store policies here, ya' know #$ I can't just wear nothing! #$ This isn't the woods. #$ So I walk into the nearest boutique. #$ And I was hoping for like maybe a quarter zip or a turtle neck #$ Real 'academia' coded. Quiet luxury. #$ And the cashier is just like "For someone of 'your' stature we only have T-shirts." #$ Unbelieveable. #$ I may have then used some improper language... #$ And then she threatened to call Animal Control. #$ So I can't go back there, but I did get this T-Shirt out of it! #$
