Did you know plants respond to lighting in different ways? #$ WAIT! #$ Before I bestow knowledge, we gotta talk about color temperatures #$ So humans (you probably) like classifying light in Kelvin, and on lights, you'll usually see the temperature as something like 2700k or 3500k #$ There's math that goes into this, but the HIGHER numbers are blue-er (5000k Daylight) and the LOWER numbers are red-er (2700k Soft White). #$ HOWEVER #$ Grow lights in particular are usually measured in something called light spectrum wavelengths (with a little nm). #$ With these, blue-er light is the SMALL side (500nm) and red-er light is the high side (700nm). #$ Scientists classify things this way because they hate us. #$ Nope. No other explaination. Don't look it up. They just want us confused. #$ ANYWAY #$ Here's the details #$ Most important is Visible Light (400-750nm): It's great for plant growth and photosynthesis your bulb should have the most of this. #$ Next is Red Light (600-750nm): It's great for photosynthesis and it helps plants grow outward and big! #$ Then we have UV light (10-399nm): This is all about color and smell (it will not help photosynthesis) #$ Last we got Blue Light (400-500nm): This does help for photosynthesis but will make your plants grow denser and more compact. #$ That was a lot! Also full disclosure I'm red-green color blind, so take what I say as highly suspect. #$
